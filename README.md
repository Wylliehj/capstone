# Dynamic Restaurant Website

This is a mock restaurant website with virtually all content dynamically created as it is directly pulled from a database.

# Installation

In both the backend and the frontend folders a simple 'npm i' will download and install required dependencies.
A SQL seed file is also given to create a database from which the API can talk to, 'psql < dynamic_restaurant.sql'.

# Tech

This project was created with Postgresql 12 for the SQL database structure, Node and Express to create the API and React for the client side site.
